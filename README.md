# hack-test

Dig through the source code to figure out the password.

## Contributions

Contributions are totally welcome. If you have an idea for a level, shoot me a
pull request following these guidelines:

*   Put all your new files in a directory under `public_html`
    *   Ensure one of these files is titled `index.html`, and is based on the
        template in the root directory of this repository
*   Give your directory a catchy name, which has no relevance to the puzzle
*   Name your pull request this same catchy name
*   Scrub your commits of anything that could give away the password
    *   I'll check for this too, but it's probably easier for you...
*   Set the content for the author meta-tag to your Github username. This is so
    that if a level is having issues, the original puzzle designer can be
    tracked down.

In terms of the code, ensure that it follows the same general structure. i.e:
*   Implements the `validate(guess)` function
*   Which returns `completeLevel(0, password)` when complete (I'll fix the
    number when I add it to the game), or false otherwise
    *   If you use asynchronous actions, you may return a promise that resolves
        to `completeLevel(0, password)` or rejects instead

Be sure you don't write the password anywhere. I'll figure it out myself, or
I'll ask you about it if I am really stuck. Once I am sure your level is in good
spirit, I'll slip it into the game somewhere.

### External packages

Though you should do your best to avoid additional dependencies, there may be
times when you want this. In that case follow this process:

1.  Check if a similar-purpose package is already included. If so, skip to 6
2.  Install the relevant package from NPM using `npm install <package> --save`
3.  Copy the *minified* source file to `public_html/resource/lib`
4.  Ensure the file name follows the format `<package>.min.js`
5.  Commit the changes to package.json, and the file you copied to the libs
    directory, but **do not** commit the entirety of node_modules
6.  Add a `data-libs` attribute to the script tag that loads the common scripts.
    The value is a comma separated list of package names, i.e:
    ```html
    <script src="{{ '/resource/common.js' | relative_url }}" data-libs="react,redux"></script>
    ```
    These packages will be loaded asynchronously automatically.

Following this process keeps unnecessary clutter away from the players, so they
can focus on solving the actual puzzle.
